My first dashboard with Tableau plotted through the covid 19 global data for the year 2020. 
It is an often used dataset for developing a Tableau Dashboard, yet I used it to as I learnt a lot through the process. 
The data is downloaded from https://data.world/ as a CSV file. 


Here's my blog post about it - https://abhinav14rd.wordpress.com/2023/10/31/my-first-tableau-dashboard/
I will keep updating this dashboard as I learn more about Tableau and the features it offers.
